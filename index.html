    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
      I am passionate about languages including both human and machine. I work with symbols and data to produce artifacts. I embarked on this remarkable journey of teaching after finishing my studies in mathematics and philosophy in Guelph, Ontario. This first took me to the Lower Mainland where 
      I discovered the power of unlocking potential. The journey continued on to the Island of Japan where I fully embraced the art of helping others. I stayed in Japan for nearly a decade and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a successul career as a <a href="public/newteaching.html">Native English Language Instructor</a>.
      I worked for <a href="https://www.aeonet.co.jp/school/aichi/">Aeon Central Japan</a>, located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture. I was the Senior Instructor at the Head School in Nagoya where students could experience studying abroad in Japan in an intensive full-time program. 
      Students were immersed in mastering English communication building their 4-Skills using techniques like Content-Based Learning and Communicative Learning under the umberage of one of Japan's leading private English Learning companyies, now operated by tech giant <a href="https://www.kddi.com/english/corporate/group/alphabet/">KDDI</a>. 
      I left my position to return home to be closer to my family and start my own tribe. Sadly, the in-person school I hold dear to my heart closed due to the shift to online learning after the Covid pandaemic swept the world.
      <!-- <a href="https://www.aeonet.co.jp/school/chubu/aichi/2353/"></a> -->
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my return to Canada, I took up coding and learning the fundamentals of Computer and Data Science in my transition from life abroad. My coding journey continues today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the recent reduction in the number of international students, I worked for the School of Business at Conestoga College teaching Business Research, Data Analysis and Business Mathematics.
