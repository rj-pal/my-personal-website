  <h3>Bio:</h3> 
  <p class="gauguin quote">“Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?”</p> 
  <p> 
    I feel that to write about myself, I am compelled to write about us all. At the very least, to consider the collective future. As the capacity for AI to reason and do intellectual work for us, we must evaluate who we are as a collective whole; in the same instance of reflecting on who we are as individuals.  
    I can only reflect on my own behalf mere speculation on where humanity might be heading. Towards a Singularity. What does this mean? What does this entail for society and culture? This space will ultimately ponder and chew on the future path of us, as these weigh on my mind.  
  </p> 
  <p> 
    As for me, I am an educator. I like to work with numbers, symbols, words, information. Equally, I relish all encounters with people, however fleeting or flourishing they may be. This is a driving force in my path as an educator.  
    I embarked on this remarkable journey of into the realm of teaching after finishing my studies in mathematics and philosophy in Guelph, Ontario. The world took me first to the Lower Mainland where I discovered the power of unlocking the potential in others through teaching.  
    The journey sailed on figuratively to the Island of Japan where I fully embraced the art of helping others to find their inner voice. I stayed in Japan for nearly a decade and a half. My life moto can be summarized in the following Japanese phrase:  
  </p> 
  <p class="kanji quote">一期一会</p> 
  <p> 
    Treating each moment and encounter like an eternity, I cherish every moment in the classroom. I had a <a href="public/newteaching.html">incredible and successul career</a> as an English language and communication skills educator in Japan. I mainly taught in and around Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.  
    My primary role was the Head School Teacher at English school where students could experience what it was like 'studying abroad' in Japan in an intensive full-time program.  
    Students were immersed in mastering English communication, building their 21st Century skills using techniques like Content-Based Learning and Communicative learning. Students engaged in discussions and analytical thought activities, in addition to practical language exercises. 
    This school was under the umbrage of one of Japan's leading private English Learning companies, <a href="https://www.aeonet.co.jp/school/aichi/">Aeon</a>, now operated  
    by Japanese tech giant <a href="https://www.kddi.com/english/corporate/group/alphabet/">KDDI</a>.  
    I left my position and life in Japan to return home to be closer to my family and start my own tribe. Sadly, the in-person school I hold dear to my heart closed due to the shift to online learning after the Covid pandemic swept the world. 
  </p> 
  <p> 
    Upon my return to Canada, the boat swayed in a new direction. I took up coding and learning the fundamentals of Computer and Data Science in my transition from life abroad. Life-long learning and upskilling is essential for work in our rapidly changing times. It is essential for me as my educator DNA is coded  
    to always learn more. My coding journey continues today with this website and many other projects that are on display in land of GitHub. My language learning also continues as I endeavour to learn the other official language of the true north strong and free. 
  </p> 
  <p> 
    I stepped back into the classroom at Conestoga College three years back. I taught Business Research and Data Analysis and Business Mathematics to international students for the School of Business. Students were engaged in learning fundamentals through discussions, projects and in-class problem solving.  
    Students were challenged to think for themselves using reason and logic, not through intuition. Follow the data. These short classroom moments were extremely humbling as I witnessed students giving their all in a new country to better their lives. This journey disembarked with the reduction in the number of international students imposed by the government. 
  </p> 
  <p> I am once again embracing self-improvement and am open to new ideas. <strong><a href="public/contact-info.html">Contact me here if you want to talk</a></strong> </p>
