    <h3>Bio:</h3> 
    <p class="gauguin quote">“Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?”</p> 
    <p>
      The social conquest of the earth may be ending its course as we transition into the algorithm conquest of the earth. The future is not written in stone. We all must make the effort to make our own chip in the stone, or else be left behind. <a href="public/reflection.html">May we live in interesting times</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can never be certain what the future holds, but it is certainly an exciting time to be alive; to be a part of the transition and not apart from it. Viewing Gauguin grounds me in place to think firmly about who I am, where I came from, and where I am going. All manifestations will be reflected here. I admit now that this space will be an indulgence into both hemispheres containing linear and non-linear elements.

      As for me, I am an educator. I come from humble beginnings born in Canada, which is a lottery-win in itself. I like to work with numbers, symbols, words, information. My school life taught me there is equal power in logic as there is in creativity. Life taught me to relish all encounters with people, however fleeting or flourishing they turn out to be. Having quality encounters was a driving force in my path as an educator. It was a driver in living the life of an ex-pat.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-pat life is entwined with the teaching journey. I embarked into the realm of teaching after finishing my studies in mathematics and philosophy in Guelph, Ontario. The journey took me first to the Lower Mainland where I discovered the joy of unlocking the potential of others. Education is matching the right key to the right door.
      I sailed on, figuratively of course, to the Island of Japan where I fully embraced the art of the Sensei. I stayed in Japan for nearly a decade and a half. My life motto can be summarized in the following Japanese phrase:  
    </p> 
    <p class="kanji quote">一期一会</p> 
    <p> 
      Treating each moment and encounter like an eternity. Classrooms experiences are a blessing. I hold dear every moment in them. I had a <a href="public/newteaching.html">incredible and successul career</a> as an English language and communication skills educator in Japan. I mainly taught in and around Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.  
      The majority of my time teaching was spent at the head of the classroom where students could experience what it was like 'studying abroad', but in Japan, in an intensive full-time program.  
      Students were immersed in mastering English communication, building their 21st Century skills through Content-Based and Communicative learning. Students engaged in discussions and analytical thought activities, in addition to practical language exercises. 
      This school was under the umbrella of one of Japan's leading private English learning companies, <a href="https://www.aeonet.co.jp/school/aichi/">Aeon</a>, now operated by Japanese tech giant <a href="https://www.kddi.com/english/corporate/group/alphabet/">KDDI</a>.  
      I left my position and life in Japan to return home to be closer to my family and start my own tribe. 
      <!-- Sadly, the in-person school where large chunks of my life were had closed due to the shifts in the market after the Covid pandemic swept the world.  -->
    </p> 
    <p> 
      Upon my return to Canada, life swayed in a new direction. I took up coding in my transition from ex-pat to being home at last. Life-long learning, upskilling, seeking new creative pathways are essential in my life. They are essential for careers in our day and age. My educator DNA is coded  
      to always learn more. My coding journey continues today with <em>this website</em> and many other projects that are on display in <a href="https://github.com/rj-pal" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. My language learning also continues as I march slowly forward learning the other official language of the true north strong and free. My Japanese is and forever will be a work in progress. Language learning never ends.

      My most recent steps back into the classroom were at Conestoga College. I taught Business Research and Data Analysis and Business Mathematics to international students for the School of Business. Students were engaged in learning fundamentals through discussions, projects and in-class problem solving of business scenerios.  
      Students were challenged to think for themselves using reason and logic to solve a problem, and not find a solution through their intuition or first thoughts. These short classroom moments were extremely rewarding as I witnessed students giving their all in a new country to try better their lives. Alas, this journey was cut short by the reduction in the number of international students imposed by the government.

    <p>As fate would have it, I am once again embracing self-improvement and am open to new ideas. <strong><a href="public/contact-info.html">Contact me here if you want to talk</a></strong>.</p>
