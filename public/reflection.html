      To write about myself, who I am, I am compelled to briefly comment on <strong>who we are</strong>. At this juncture in our collective timeline, any thoughts or actions must consider the collective future, and not just our personal future. As the capacity for AI to reason and do intellectual work for us expands into every aspect of our lives, we must evaluate who we are as a collective whole in the same instance of self-reflection on who we are as individuals. It is an inseperable act.

      We have come so far and built the world we desire through a long, drawn out process of thesis, anti-thesis and sythesis. Even more so today, we can build the world of our dreams. At the same time, it seems we are handing the process of dreaming over more and more to the machines. It has yet to be determined if this will ultimately be a good thing or a bad thing. I can only speculate on my own behalf where humanity might be heading. Towards the Singularity. Towards the end of work. Towards a new shared culture. Towards a sustainable future.
      For now, I will leave it at these opening remarks. I hope to use this space to ponder our course. Primarily, to ponder my own. This space is all about me.
